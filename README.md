- 👋 Hi, I’m @Drunkula
- 👀 I’m interested in making things more fun and free for Twitch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...pfffft, too much stuff.
- 💞️ I’m working on a plugin based bot for Twitch.tv that will run either under Node.js or where applicable directly within a browser.
The idea is provide a framework with a plugin directory that'll let you easily add functionality such as chat commands, automated bot announcements that
could interact with chatters, making sure they're in the chat, not calling out lurkers, etc.  I've already built a text to speech system that chatters
can call directly, or you could use for announcements.

- 📫 How to reach me ... I'll add that later.
